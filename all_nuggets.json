She'll need more information about their overall media\n                journey. What kind of media channels do they engage with? Do they purchase online\n                or in-store? Which devices do they use while shopping for shoes? Ms. Smith starts\n                by looking at ABC's marketing mix—digital display ads, paid and organic search ads,\n                social media, TV ads, and print ads—and all of the various touchpoints (any\n                interaction she may have had with these channels). Attribution\n                helps Ms. Smith identify patterns and trends across all marketing channels (e.g.,\n                after seeing an ad on a specific TV channel, a prospective buyer’s search takes her\n                to ABC's website). What’s more, Ms. Smith can see that social media is resulting in\n                a positive lift for ABC’s email campaigns and increasing sales. The analysis also\n                shows that buyers sometimes research products online and then make their final\n                purchase at the local ABC store. That leads Ms. Smith to adjust her marketing\n                budget accordingly so she’s properly reaching her omni-channel shoppers—and ABC\n                ensures that it has even more happy customers.\n              ","accentcolorsecondary":"","keywords":"","accentcolor":"","backgroundcolor":"","itemtype":"article","author":"","imagelayout":"wide","formatteddate":"5/1/2015","date":"5/6/2015","legend":"","primarytopic":"advertising","freeze":"TRUE","country":"united-states","industry":"advertising","title":"","mediachannel":"","rowNumber":28},{"url":"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/path-to-better-measurement-analytics-attribution.html","articletitle":"\n      The Path to Better Measurement: Analytics and Attribution – Think with Google\n    ","layout":"inline","imageurl":"//storage.googleapis.com/think/images/online-shopping-vs-brick-mortar.jpg","graphtitle":"","caption":"","below":"","headline":"\n                To gain a better understanding of why and how a company would use both\n                analytics and attribution, let's take a\n                look at the following hypothetical scenario:\n              ","accentcolorsecondary":"","keywords":"","accentcolor":"","backgroundcolor":"","itemtype":"article","author":"","imagelayout":"wide","formatteddate":"5/1/2015","date":"5/6/2015","legend":"","primarytopic":"advertising","freeze":"TRUE","country":"united-states","industry":"advertising","title":"","mediachannel":"","rowNumber":29},{"url":"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/path-to-better-measurement-analytics-attribution.html","articletitle":"\n      The Path to Better Measurement: Analytics and Attribution – Think with Google\n    ","layout":"inline","imageurl":"//storage.googleapis.com/think/images/test-sketch-3.png","graphtitle":"","caption":"","below":"","headline":"\n                It's Ms. Smith's job to figure out how to sell more shoes to these young\n                professional women.

Do they click on\n                paid search ads after a specific query (say, a search for \"cute wedge heels for\n                spring\")? Which parts of the website do they visit?

moms: These confident cooks love food, and they're\n                  looking for creative inspiration for new twists on family recipes. Sixty-eight\n                  percent of them purchase food products featured in the videos they\n                  watch.5 Sixty-nine percent of these highly engaged moms watch food\n                  videos every week, and 68% of them will also watch videos while\n                  cooking.6\n\n\nMillennial women: They're special-occasion cooks who want to\n                  improve their cooking skills. Only one in four millennial women would call\n                  themselves a good cook, compared with their mom counterparts, of whom three out\n                  of five said they were.7 Millennial women tend to cook for social\n                  occasions rather than regular meals, seeking inspiration from baking and\n                  appetizer videos. While three out of four millennial women are open to watching\n                  branded food content, close to half (43%) have not done so, representing a\n                  significant opportunity for brands to gain new audiences.8\n\n\nMillennial dads: These dads are cooking as often as millennial\n                  moms. Out of all four audience segments, they are the most engaged with food\n                  content on YouTube, watching videos to spark inspiration and create meals.\n                  They're proud of their role as the family cook and inspired by new food\n                  techniques, products and ideas. With a technique-driven approach to food,\n                  millennial dads tend to think in terms of \"how-to\" instead of \"recipe\"\n                  when it comes to food videos. And 42% of them will make special trips to the\n                  store to buy products they learn about in food videos.9\n\n\nMillennial men: They're self-assured in the kitchen (68%\n                  described themselves as a \"confident cook\"—2x more than their millennial\n                  female counterparts).10 This group is focused on honing their cooking\n                  expertise. Sixty-nine percent of millennial men watch branded food content on\n                  YouTube, and they're happy to do so as long as the videos are entertaining and\n                  not purely functional.11 They're most likely to watch YouTube food\n                  videos to be entertained by food personalities, such as Jamie Oliver, or popular\n                  food shows such as
