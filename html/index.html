<!-- What's needed here is three HTML structures that can be templatized.
	1. Graph structure
	2. Inline image structure w/o headline above or small line below
	3. Inline image structure w/ headline above and/or small line below
It may be possible to make 2 and 3 the same template, and just not display the headline or small line if they aren't applicable.
